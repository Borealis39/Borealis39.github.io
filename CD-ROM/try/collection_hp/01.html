This image was uploaded to the internet to announce the beginning of serialization.<br>
Even though I kept talking about serialization, absolutely nooooothing ever got posted!<br>
There were a ton of people who thought otherwise, but that really is the truth.<br>
I much prefer announcing things than actually creating them, so that was a pretty careless thing to write.<br>
The reason for writing "@TRIATHLON" is becuase this was the homepage where "Try! Try! Try!" would be published.<br>
The private office known as "TRIATHLON" and the artist "Kiyohiko Azuma" became one in the same,<br>
now known as "YOTUBA SUTAZIO".<br>
